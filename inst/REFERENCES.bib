abstract = {The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn from the fields of data compression, statistical language modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a collection of modelling strategies which together yield significant performance improvements over existing methods. In the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research, the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast to previous research, however, the methodological framework developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of composition enables a detailed empirical examination and comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and resolution of their weaknesses.},

@article{Cleary1984,
abstract = {The recently developed technique of arithmetic coding, in conjunction with a Markov model of the source, is a powerful method of data compression in situations where a linear treatment is inappropriate. Adaptive coding allows the model to be constructed dynamically by both encoder and decoder during the course of the transmission, and has been shown to incur a smaller coding overhead than explicit transmission of the model's statistics. But there is a basic conflict between the desire to use high-order Markov models and the need to have them formed quickly as the initial part of the message is sent. This paper describes how the conflict can be resolved with partial string matching, and reports experimental results which show that mixed-case English text can be coded in as little as 2.2 bits/ character with no prior knowledge of the source.
